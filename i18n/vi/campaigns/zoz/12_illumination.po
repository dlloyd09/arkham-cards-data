msgid "Still fatigued from the city's defense, you summon your strength and begin to march.  Dorothy, also weary but trying to keep positive, walks alongside you, with Toto trotting behind her briskly.  \"We've fought those monsters several times now, but I ain't never seen them run from you like that before!  If you can keep doin' that, I 'spect that you'll run them clean out of Oz for good!\"  It all sounds so simple in the words of the Kansas farmgirl, but pressing the attack is the only choice.  You continue your walk toward the closest gate to the Colour, and one by one, your companions rejoin you in your march.  Like yourself, they have been tried and tested in the long fight against the Colour, and are ready to do or die.  As you approach the battered entryway, the Guardian of the Gate stands ready -- if nervously -- to open it for you.  Any last words?"

msgid "You've been this far together, but despite their own abilities, the citizens of Oz still rely on your experience with eldritch matters.  It falls to you to lead your companions, and so you encourage them one final time before the reckoning."

msgid "<b>The Wizard</b>, already a small and wrinkled man, looks more wizened since you first met.  He holds his bag of magic tightly in his thin hands as he readies himself.  \"This is it, is it?\" he asks you with a tired smile, \"Twice now I've lived a life and thought I'd seen it all, from carnival barker to Oz the Great and Powerful, and now?  Well, let's secure that third life before I start more speculation.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Scarecrow</b> massages his temples with one hand as you turn toward him.  The crunkling sound of his straw is dull, but he still wears a satisfied smile.  \"Now I wouldn't say that things are making sense just yet, but there seems to be some logic at work here after all!  From the start I've been worried that my brains wouldn't amount to anything to help Oz, but now?  I think we have the best chances out of anyone in the whole world.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Tin Woodman</b> runs his thumb along the edge of his silver axe, scratching each chip and tarnished spot with some visible pride.  \"It's a strange thing, but my shining axe seems the better for losing its luster.  It has protected the ones I hold dear and survived a great many frights.  Nothing is so hollow as a world where my tender heart has nothing to cherish, so I have little fear of what becomes of my tin body so long as it saves my friends.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Tik-Tok</b> offers you one of his winding keys with a harsh creaking of his brass body.  His expression remains much the same, but there seems a strange depth to it this time.  \"Will you wind my rea-son tight-ly?  I can on-ly think as well as Smith and Tin-ker built me to think, but per-haps there are thoughts in my rea-son that e-ven they did not know a-bout.  Thoughts like yours, that are not mud-dled by strange-ness.\""

msgid "<b>Jack Pumpkinhead</b> sits on a nearby fencepost with his own head in his hands.  He runs his hands over it like a fortune teller with a crystal ball before finally returning it to his shoulders.  \"I've been worried all this time about my head going bad, but it's the world going bad around it instead.  Maybe it's unkind to say that about the world, but I've seen pumpkins go just as bad.  And when they do, all you can do is take the seeds and grow another better one.  Do you suppose that will work with Oz?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Patchwork Girl</b> has taken some very strange motions into her tumbling and twirling.  Half of her dances cut off suddenly and go straight into other ones, which cause some of her torn patches to flutter briefly.  \"Do you see what I'm doing?\" she asks with a proud smile, \"It's unpredictable, isn't it?  We've been facing unpredictable things for some time now, and those monsters have had the advantage the whole time.  Well now it's our turn to be unpredictable and see how they like it!  I'll bet you can be very surprising!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Frogman</b> practically leaps before you, in contrast to his dried and somewhat pale appearance.  \"I'll share with you some wisdom I have determined from our recent perils.  Something we have been sorely lacking: instinct.  We have behaved as wisely as we can, but our foes defy sound wisdom and well-thought advice.  What else remains to fight with, then?  Reflex and raw skill.  Truth is wisdom, so we must be true to our own natures.  These will see us through.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Cap'n Bill</b> focuses his attention on the sky, listening to the hollow wind that blows over the city walls.  His weathered appearance has grown haggard in your short time together.  \"It's changing, mark me,\" he mutters, \"but it's up to us to stick to our posts and ensure we weather the storm at hand.  I've never faced a disaster at sea worse than this one -- not even the one that cost me my leg -- but determination saved the other one.  We'll need every ounce we can muster now.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>Shaggy Man</b> runs his hands through the frayed fringes of his shaggy clothes, watching small bits detach and flutter to the ground.  \"It's like seasons changing.  I weep to see Oz in this barren state, but it's only a season.  It's a powerful and harsh winter as ever I've seen, and not natural by any means, but it will pass.  I will give my all to see Oz blossom again, and if it means taking a willow switch to things that may very well destroy me, then so be it!\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Cowardly Lion</b> growls, strained and with a faint whine through the nose, but unmistakably an aggressive sound.  \"I am still very dreadfully afraid, but there is nothing left to hide me.  If I am to be hunted by these monsters no matter where I go, then my fear will be the same no matter how I face them.  That isn't bravery, is it?\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Hungry Tiger</b> is more gaunt and lean than you have ever seen him before.  He snarls and pounds his paws against the stone pavement.  \"Greed is what it is!  The invaders have eaten more than their fair share.  More than they could ever be hungry for, and I know more of hunger than anyone!  I will make it spit them all up again, and give them time to clean up before I devour them myself.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "<b>The Sawhorse</b> clops his metal-tipped legs on the cobblestones, though you clearly hear the creak of warped wood from the motion.  \"Our enemies are on the run, but they cannot escape me, friend human.  It may not ever stop, but neither will I.  My legs can be repaired, and will carry you to any corner of Oz -- or beyond, if it is needed.\""
msgstr ""

msgid "Whether by genuine optimism, bravado, or simply having nothing left to lose, your companions stand ready and willing to sally forth.  The Colour awaits, building its strength, and you cannot afford to let it attack the Emerald City a second time, even with the discovery of how to repel it.  The Colour is the ultimate in attrition and cannot be outlasted.  It must be removed without delay."

"The burden upon you is strangely light for the gravity of the situation.  You have been building up to this reckoning since you first set out from Arkham, and have braced yourself multiple times for the task.  You nod to the Guardian of the Gates, and the tarnished doors swing wide open.\n"
"Ozma and Glinda approach behind you with the city's hopeful in tow, all wishing you the very best of luck.  The queen and sorceress remain to preserve the Emerald City as the source of regrowth should your mission succeed, and the common folk can offer little else but hope, for risk of becoming infected thralls of the Colour.  With your own abilities and tools ready at hand, you signal to your comrades to join your march through the city gates and out into the blasted countryside."
