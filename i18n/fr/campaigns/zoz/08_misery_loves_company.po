"A second invasion?  There may be strategic value in attacking while Oz is scrambling to protect itself from the Colour, but to what end?  If this new army puts a stop to your efforts, there won't be anything to conquer but miles of ashen wilderness.  You pull Woot the Wanderer back to his feet and toward the palace so he can give his full account before Ozma.\n"
"\"Do you all remember when the Nomes tried to invade the Emerald City some time ago?\" he asks the assembled court, \"and brought the Whimsies, the Growleywogs, and the Phanfasms all with them?  Well that's exactly what they're trying again!  They didn't tunnel all the way underneath the city this time though.  They popped up out in the country there, and are destroying everything in sight in a blind fury!  Captain Fyter tried to hold them off, but he only slowed them down enough for me and a few others to escape!\"\n"
"Ozma covers her mouth with one hand as she thinks.  \"Woot, you have seen the Colour in your wanderings, yes?  Did these enemies show any signs of infection?\"  Woot nods without hesitation, and Ozma shakes her head in exasperation.  \"This must be Ruggedo's doing.  Or rather the work of the Colour infecting him.  It has used him to rally distant enemies of Oz to protect itself.\"  Glinda stands confidently to address the court.  \"This is heartening, your majesty, for if the Colour is trying to target us, then we must be a threat to it as well.  It means that our efforts are doing some good after all.\"\n"
"Ozma agrees quietly and turns toward you.  \"It shames me to ask for your help in stopping this invasion when you have already done so much for us.  But will you stand up to these united enemies?\"  You appreciate the gesture, but you have little choice in the matter.  This army is targeting you just as much as the rest of Oz, and if you don't stop them, then your chances of expelling the Colour will be very slim indeed.  You assure Ozma you that you will meet them on the field of battle and go to prepare yourself."

msgid "The invasion forced proved to be more than you could hold back, and they rush the city in a haze of bloodlust.  Already monstrously strong in their own right and empowered by the Colour, they tear into the stone walls and lashing out any any last-minute defenders.  Brick by brick, the wall disappears, but as the invaders poise to storm the city, their rage boils over.  Influenced by the Colour as they are, their wild emotions are stronger still, and they devolve into a brutal melee.  Minutes later, the army is broken and scattered, but at great expense."

"With the bulk of the fighting finished in your favor, you escort General Guph back toward the Emerald City.  Though not a cheerful person in any capacity, Guph has taken a dignified acceptance of his defeat, again showing that his mind is still his own.  You ask the Nome how he is still sane when the other warriors are steeped in the Colour.\n"
"\"There was something clearly amiss when Ruggedo suddenly returned to the Nome Kingdom brimming with power,\" he grumbles, \"I've lived long enough to recognize any kind of magic, but this was something different... and horrible.  I immediately volunteered to assemble the old alliance that once tried to conquer Oz just to get away from its influence.  My only hope was to take the Emerald City and hold it, far away from Ruggedo -- and it would have worked, if you hadn't poked your noses into it.\"  With the way that the Colour corrupts the earth, it makes sense that the Nomes would be strongly affected, being earth spirits themselves.  You hope that a sane and somewhat cooperative Nome on your side will be a solid advantage for the tasks ahead."

msgid "This is without a doubt the most beleaguered that Oz has ever been.  The Colour has degraded most of the surrounding countryside to a gray waste, and the two back-to-back attacks have severely taxed the resources and morale of the citizens of Oz.  At this point, anyone left sane and alive is within the walls of the Emerald City, and looking to you for salvation.  You've come too far to back out now, and the whole planet is likely doomed anyhow if you don't fight back.  You return to the palace once again to regroup and finally form a plan of action.  The counterattack begins now."
