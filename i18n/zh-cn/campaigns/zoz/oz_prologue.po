"<fancy>Thursday, April 8th, 1926.  Arkham, Massachusetts.</fancy>\n"
"<fancy>This was not the first time the brilliant meteorite had struck Earth.  Few but old Ammi Pierce still talked about the strange days when the Gardner farm was transformed into the blasted heath, but the scientific record remained in the archives of Miskatonic University.  That record spoke of the same alien colour that appeared in the spectroscope the astronomers took of a second meteor approaching Earth rapidly last week.  Claims and theories flew, but the scientists agreed that this time, the meteorite must be recovered in full for both study and to protect the world from its possible destruction.  Funding for an expedition was amassed in short order, including stipulations for a team of specialists with experience in the weird mysteries of the universe.</fancy>"

"You were alongside the astronomers as they first tracked and calculated the trajectory of the meteor.\n"
"It was easily traced by the bizarre colour that glowed faintly around it, unlike anything seen in the natural spectrum of light.  The colour flashed and waned in a pattern that defied the usual explanation of atmospheric interference that caused stars to twinkle.  The colour undulated as if it were living... and growing.  A horrid sense of foreboding traveled with the meteor as you bore witness to the start of events that may not be possible to stop.  Your one consolation was that your observations helped the astronomers complete their analysis of the meteor using modern equipment and methods."
