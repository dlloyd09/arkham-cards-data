"As you recuperate from your first foray into the infected countries, a young man dressed in blue rushes up to the city gates breathlessly.  \"The witches... th-they're assembling out there!\" he gasps to you.  Dorothy pats the young man on the back encouragingly.  \"It can't be as bad as all that, can it Ojo?  Most of the witches in Oz have lost their power, and we have Glinda and Ozma protecting us with magic of their own.\"  Ojo shakes his head, still visibly panicked.  \"I overheard some of them talking.  They're going to harness that Colour everyone's trying to stop!  A witch named Mombi was rallying them to take their revenge against us all!  I knew that my luck would never really change!\"  He points behind him at the countryside, visibly darkening but for splotches of the Colour.\n"
"Glinda's expression hardens as she looks alongside you.  \"People like Mombi can never live peacefully while they still lust for power above all else.  She once had Ozma transformed in an attempt to keep her from succeeding the throne of Oz... but that is a story for another time.  The fallen witches' attempt to control the Colour can only lead to destruction -- for both them and for us.  We have to stop them from tampering with the Colour before they cause irreversible harm!\""
