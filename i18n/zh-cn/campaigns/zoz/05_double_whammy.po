"As you recuperate from your first foray into the infected countries, a young man dressed in blue rushes up to the city gates breathlessly.  \"The witches... th-they're assembling out there!\" he gasps to you.  Dorothy pats the young man on the back encouragingly.  \"It can't be as bad as all that, can it Ojo?  Most of the witches in Oz have lost their power, and we have Glinda and Ozma protecting us with magic of their own.\"  Ojo shakes his head, still visibly panicked.  \"I overheard some of them talking.  They're going to harness that Colour everyone's trying to stop!  A witch named Mombi was rallying them to take their revenge against us all!  I knew that my luck would never really change!\"  He points behind him at the countryside, visibly darkening but for splotches of the Colour.\n"
"Glinda's expression hardens as she looks alongside you.  \"People like Mombi can never live peacefully while they still lust for power above all else.  She once had Ozma transformed in an attempt to keep her from succeeding the throne of Oz... but that is a story for another time.  The fallen witches' attempt to control the Colour can only lead to destruction -- for both them and for us.  We have to stop them from tampering with the Colour before they cause irreversible harm!\""

msgid "Dazzling light coats the countryside in a sickly shade as the witches' ritual finally culminates.  A column of Colour, arcing like the jet of a fire horse, blasts toward the Emerald City.  The contact immediately discolours the pristine walls and begins to gouge into the stone, layer by layer.  The screams of panicked citizens spurs you faster toward the city, but a second chorus of screams sounds from behind you.  The voices of the witches slowly distort and crumble, and as their voices fade, so too does the arcing Colour.  This attempt at revenge has cost them their lives, but the Emerald City has been scarred by their plot."

"With the ringleader subdued, the remaining witches retreat back into the dense forests.  Mombi glares hatefully at you as you escort her back toward the Emerald City -- more carrying her than marching her due to her drained state.  Her skin is rapidly graying and she mumbles to herself in unearthly tones.\n"
"Glinda and Ozma are waiting at the gates for your arrival, ready to administer a stern punishment, but the sight of Mombi shocks them both.  \"The poor creature...\" Ozma muses quietly.  Glinda nods, but keeps a careful eye on the witch.  \"Yes, it is the end of a path that she chose for herself.  Hatred rarely gives you what you want.\"  The queen orders the soldier with green whiskers to escort Mombi to one of the houses in town where they can monitor her deteriorating state.  You don't know how long Mombi will last, or if her degradation can be stopped at all, but the witch's bitter persistence has carried her this far.  Perhaps she can still help vanquish the Colour indirectly."

msgid "Your return to the city is followed by a wave of refugees escaping the spreading Colour.  The infection was already progressing faster than expected, but the witches have sped things along considerably.  The painfully vibrant hues painting the landscape have already begun to dim -- a sign of the Colour's second phase.  As before, exposure to the Colour has taken a toll on the allies who fought alongside you.  The people of Oz -- and you -- can't sustain a long-term siege.  There must be some way to drive out the Colour quickly and decisively.  You ask the guardian of the gates to summon the others to the palace once again."
