"As your companions rise from the table and set to work, you ask Dorothy for more about Polychrome.  \"She's one of the rainbow's daughters,\" the young girl states matter-of-factly, \"and she knows some fairy magic besides.  Polly's helped us before, but we never know just when she'll show up.  Most of the rainbow's daughters don't stray off the rainbow, but Polly likes dancin' near the end, and sometimes she falls down into Oz.\"  This development leaves you puzzled to say the least.  There's no guarantee that Polychrome will show up when it rains, and now that you think of it, there have only been clear skies since you arrived in Oz.  You ask Dorothy about the weather and she frowns with some concern.  \"It hardly ever rains in Oz since it's supposed to be nice all the time.\"\n"
"You exit the dining room feeling as though your chances of success are out of your control, but you are approached by Dorothy's other companions her own age -- Betsy Bobbin and Trot.  \"We may not be able to control the weather,\" Betsy says positively, \"but we do have something to show you!\"  The two lead you up through the palace to Ozma's room -- which you hesitate to enter until Dorothy makes it clear that you're welcome.  Betsy pulls you toward one wall while Trot pulls aside a curtain.  Behind it sits a painting, or at least a blank canvas inside an ornate frame.\n"
"\"Now I bet you've never seen anything like this before!\" Dorothy exclaims.  \"This is Ozma's magic picture.  You just ask it to show you somebody, and it does!  Just like lookin' through a window!\"  It doesn't take much thought to realize the potential uses of the picture.  Trot, the youngest but most serious of the trio, stands by morosely.  \"I hope it helps us find Polly.  Ozma tried to find Ruggedo after he vanished with the meteor, but could only see that he was somewhere underground -- and that could be anywhere.\"  You turn to the painting and state Polychrome's name, and the fabric suddenly blossoms with color.  There moving on the canvas are a group of brightly colored fairies dancing on clouds, but more importantly, a landscape visible beneath them in a very distinct hue."

msgid "The landscape behind you withers and crumbles like burnt paper kindling as you reach the relative safety of the Emerald City.  Trees and houses fall apart like spent cigars, but not before twisting into alien forms.  The storm seems to have further fed the degradation of the land, poisoning the water itself as you have seen before.  You can only hope that Polychrome was not misfortunate enough to be stranded in that bleak countryside."

"You return to the Emerald City at a brisk pace, ahead of the advancing decay, but with enough leeway to bring Polly up to speed on the state of Oz.  The rainbow fairy listens attentively, and with a very serious expression, but she still keeps in constant motion, dancing and twirling.  \"Goodness, what a horrid thing... I do not know if my magic can affect something as unnatural as this Colour from space, but I shall try!  So many of my friends are at risk!  And it shall spoil my father's own colors besides!\"\n"
"You hope that Polychrome does indeed have the ability to fight the Colour with her own magic, but stopping the Colour is only one part of the fight.  The Gardner farm to this day is called the Blasted Heath because of the lasting damage inflicted on it.  Of course you didn't have the magic of Oz back in Arkham, so you can only pray that it makes the difference, but recovery of any kind at all is still only an earnest wish right now."

msgid "With the rampant Colour and worsening state of the countries, the Emerald City is practically under siege.  Even the few bitter enemies of Oz left seem hell-bent on destroying you and your companions before the inevitable end.  How much of this conflict is their own desire and how much is from the Colour twisting their psyches has yet to be determined.  Is there no end to the violence?  As if to answer your question, a young man staggers breathlessly through the streets nearby you, rushing toward the palace.  \"Why, it's Woot the Wanderer!\" Dorothy exclaims, and moves to meet him.  At the sight of Dorothy, Woot collapses onto a nearby bench.  He points behind himself, back out toward the countryside as he summons the air to explain.  \"Invasion!  An army is invading from across the deserts -- or under it!\""
