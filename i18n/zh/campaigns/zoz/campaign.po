This is done by checking the appropriate boxes on the second page of the Campaign Log. Fatigue has no game effect except when explicitly referenced by the Campaign Guide or by a card effect.\n"
"Each companion cannot have more than 5 fatigue marked to their name. <b>If at any point a companion reaches 5 fatigue, cross that companion's name off in the Campaign Log.</b> Companions with crossed off names cannot be chosen during scenario setups or have corresponding sections in the Campaign Guide read.  Companions in play that reach 5 fatigue during a scenario are immediately removed from the game."

All the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours, and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region. No sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage; but everywhere those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased, underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth.\"\n"
