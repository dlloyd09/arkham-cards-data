She directs you toward the royal dining hall, where Ozma and Glinda are already seated.  Your new companions file in close behind you, but you all seat yourselves in sobered silence.  In great contrast to your first meeting at the palace, everyone now understands just how serious a threat the Colour is, and are coming to terms with it at their own paces.\nOzma herself is tense, having never led her people through events as grim and dire as these.  Dorothy helps to reassure her friend that you are doing all you can to stop the Colour, but progress is hard to measure at this stage.  On the contrary, it seems that the Colour is making more progress against you and your comrades."
